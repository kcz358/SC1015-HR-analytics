## Problem Definition

Predicting whether a person will find a new job or remain unchanged based on information such as demographics, education and working experience.


## Models Used

1. Logistic Regression
2. Support Vector Machine
3. Random Forest
4. XGBoost
5. LightGBM


## What did we learn from this project?

- Kfold validation to tune the model and see the average performance of the model
- Different strategies to handle the imbalanced dataset
- Boosting method for trees
- Different metrics such as the roc curve and f1 score for classification
